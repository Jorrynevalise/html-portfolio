<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tang Hui Hui. I am 29 years old woman. I was born in Sibu, a city located in Sarawak, Malaysia.
   Currently I am working as a kindergarten teacher at Tadika Kasih Setia, Muar. I have been committed in this school for around 4 years.
   I graduated at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, with bachelor degree in Mathematics Technology.I started to work
   as kindergarten teacher after graduating from university. The reason I did not go into my professional area was I have burdens towards kids,
   which I felt I want to do something meaningful to transform current situation in young age generation. On top of that, my Maths was not good enough.

<p>I am a Christian. I started to follow Christ at 16. My life started to transform since 18, when I started to experience God.
   My life encountered another transformation when I entered university and joined Hope Church Batu Pahat. I met many new brothers 
   and sisters, who accepted me, love me and encouraged me to grow maturely in Christ. However, things always did not going well forever.
   When I decided to stay in Muar after graduating, working as a kindergarten teacher, my life turned upside-down. I had a very terrible
   and suffering 4 years of working life here, meeting people who was not really as normal, as mature as who I ever met in my whole life.
   Recently, I found myself dianogsed with Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD). It explained why my whole life was determined by shyness, fear of rejection,
   sensitive with critisism and always cannot making friends, or even maintaining relationship. It was not in God's plan, definitely, 
   but I know that He is helping me to get through all these kinds of difficulties in my life. God never fails us.

  I am currently learning programming, all by myself. I wished I can earn extra money to ease my current life, and help my family financially.
  For my future, I have no clue about it. For the next 6 months, I will turn into 30. I wished and prayed that after A3 conference, my life will transformed fully 
  in Jesus Name. I want my life different than ever before.
